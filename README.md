The First project on the Odin's Project 
Well my html is rusty so the Odin's blower reminded of that and now am looking forword on using real html tags unlike the divs i have been addicted to for a more understandable code base.
A really i had a github account for years but i couldn't use it, i even lost most of my projects on hard drives but TOP has made sure of it that i use git and github for my coming projects, thanks.
