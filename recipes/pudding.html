    <h3>Grandma's Corn Pudding</h3>
    <p>Grandma's corn pudding is comfort food at its best. This creamy corn casserole is easy to make with both whole kernel and cream-style corn, resulting in a custardy pudding that will be a welcome addition to your holiday table.</p>
    <p>Corn pudding is a creamy side made with stewed corn, butter, and milk. It often features a thickening agent, such as cornstarch, to make the dish extra decadent.
        Corn pudding originated in the American South and can be served all year long, but it's frequently associated with Thanksgiving.</p>
