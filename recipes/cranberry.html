                Cranberry Sauce Ingredients
            </b></h3>
            <p>Believe it or not, this homemade cranberry sauce comes together quickly and easily with just three easy-to-find ingredients. Here's what you'll need:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><i>Fresh Cranberries:</i> Opt for fresh cranberries that are firm, plump, and blemish-free. Lighter colored cranberries are best for sauce, as they contain more pectin and result in a thicker consistency.</li>
                <li><i>Sugar:</i> White sugar does more than add sweetness to classic cranberry sauce: It also absorbs liquid and, when heated, thickens the sauce.</li>
                <li><i>Orange Juice:</i> All cranberry sauce starts with a liquid base. If you don't like orange juice, you can substitute pomegranate juice or even red wine.</li>
            </ul>
