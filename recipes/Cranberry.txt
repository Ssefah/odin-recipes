**A Culinary Delight: Cranberry Sauce**

Cranberry sauce, a culinary delight that graces Thanksgiving and holiday tables, is a harmonious blend of tartness and sweetness, a symphony of flavors that perfectly complements roasted meats and hearty dishes. Its vibrant ruby hue adds a touch of festive cheer to any gathering, while its tangy taste awakens the palate and cuts through the richness of traditional holiday fare.

From the moment its aroma wafts through the kitchen, cranberry sauce evokes memories of cozy family gatherings and cherished traditions. Its preparation, a simple yet rewarding endeavor, often brings generations together, fostering a sense of warmth and shared anticipation. Whether served alongside a succulent roast turkey or savored as a standalone treat, cranberry sauce remains a timeless culinary gem, a testament to the enduring power of simple, well-crafted flavors.
Cranberry Sauce Ingredients
Believe it or not, this homemade cranberry sauce comes together quickly and easily with just three easy-to-find ingredients. Here's what you'll need:

Fresh Cranberries: Opt for fresh cranberries that are firm, plump, and blemish-free. Lighter colored cranberries are best for sauce, as they contain more pectin and result in a thicker consistency.
Sugar: White sugar does more than add sweetness to classic cranberry sauce: It also absorbs liquid and, when heated, thickens the sauce.
Orange Juice: All cranberry sauce starts with a liquid base. If you don't like orange juice, you can substitute pomegranate juice or even red wine.

Directions
Step 1
Gather all ingredients.
Step 2
Dissolve sugar in the orange juice in a medium saucepan over medium heat.
Step 3
Stir in the cranberries and cook until they start to pop, about 10 minutes.
Step 4
Remove from heat and place sauce in a bowl. It will thicken as it cools.
Step 5
